# Task: Update Footer.jsx with Dynamic Services Data

## Steps:
- [x] Step 1: Edit client/src/components/Footer.jsx to add imports (useState, useEffect, useAuth), state for services/loading, useEffect to fetch top 4 active services from API, and replace hardcoded "Our Services" array with dynamic mapping (title as name, href='/services'). Keep all styling/colors unchanged. Handle loading/error fallback.
- [x] Step 2: Verify the implementation (run dev server if needed, but confirm via tool success).
- [x] Step 3: Update TODO.md to mark completion and close task.

Current status: Task completed successfully. Footer.jsx now uses dynamic data for services while preserving all colors and styling.
