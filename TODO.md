# TODO: Improve HeroSection.jsx UI and Fix Mobile Banner Display

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Update background image styling to use `bg-contain` on mobile and `bg-cover` on desktop to show full banner on mobile
- [x] Add a prominent call-to-action button below the trust indicators for better user engagement
- [x] Enhance the gradient overlay for a more beautiful visual effect
- [ ] Ensure all elements (text, buttons, indicators) are fully responsive with proper spacing
- [ ] Add subtle animations or hover effects for interactivity
- [ ] Test the component in a browser, especially on mobile view, to verify the banner displays completely
- [ ] Run the development server if needed to preview changes
