# TODO: Fix Service Specifications UI

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance the Specifications tab in Servicedetail.jsx by adding more service details
- [ ] Add Base Price specification with icon
- [ ] Add Special Notes count specification
- [ ] Add Materials Used count specification
- [ ] Add Created Date specification
- [ ] Improve styling and layout for better visual appeal

## Information Gathered
- Servicedetail.jsx has a Specifications tab showing basic info: duration, category, status, images count
- Service model includes additional displayable fields: basePrice, specialNotes, materialsUsed, createdAt
- Current layout uses grid with specs on left (col-span-2) and FAQ on right (col-span-3)

## Plan
- Modify the specifications section to include more comprehensive service details
- Use consistent styling with icons and better formatting
- Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Dependent Files
- client/src/pages/Customer/Servicedetail.jsx

## Followup Steps
